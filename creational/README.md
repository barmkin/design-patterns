# Creational Design Patterns

Creational design patterns are a set of software design principles that provide solutions for object creation mechanisms, making it easier to instantiate and configure objects in a flexible and efficient manner. These patterns help manage the process of creating objects, balancing factors like flexibility, simplicity, and performance in various software scenarios.

## [Singleton Pattern](./singletonPattern/)

The Singleton Pattern is a creational design pattern used in software engineering to ensure that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It restricts the instantiation of a class to a single object, ensuring that there is no way to create multiple instances of the same class within the application.

The Singleton Pattern is often used when you want to maintain a single instance of a class that controls access to a shared resource, configuration settings, or a unique system-wide object. It is commonly used to provide centralized control over resources that are expensive to create or need to be shared across various parts of the application.
